# Code Quiz

A weekday scheduler capable of saving daily tasks to local storage.

## Description

The scheduler will receive text into the text area and, upon pressing the save icon, push that to local storage for future retrieval. Each day will present the user with a clear list.

This was my first opportunity to build extensively with jQuery. Mixing strings and variables through the code allowed me to streamline much of the process into a few simple for-loops.

## Installation and Usage

Web application, hosted at: https://tomasdiaz83.github.io/WorkDayScheduler/

## Screenshots

The following images show the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Roadmap

The following features could be developed to better the scheduler's functionality:
- Ability to dynamically change date and see prior day's tasks
- User specify automatic "new day" so as to allow for evening before planning
- Ability to copy over prior day's tasks
